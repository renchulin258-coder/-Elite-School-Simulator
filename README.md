# 校长模拟器-Principal Simulator
Principal Simulator is a 20-year management game where you build a top-tier high school from the ground up.

As the principal, every decision is yours. Invest in teacher training, upgrade facilities, enhance academic programs, or launch elite classes—all within a tight annual budget and limited action points. Your choices shape the school's core stats: Academic Level, Faculty Strength, Campus Facilities, and Reputation.

These stats determine student outcomes. Each year, three grades of students study, take exams, and eventually graduate. Their college admission results—whether they enter top-tier universities like Tsinghua and Peking, prestigious 985/211 institutions, or other first-tier colleges—become the true measure of your success.

You can also form partnerships with renowned universities, unlocking special admission channels and long-term bonuses that propel your school into a virtuous cycle of growth.

Watch your school evolve over two decades—from a modest beginning to an educational landmark. Detailed analytics, annual graduate reports, and milestone tracking let you witness the impact of every choice.

Principal Simulator blends strategic planning with the satisfaction of nurturing talent and building a legacy. It's a journey of leadership, vision, and lasting impact.

Will your school become a legend? The story begins with you.
